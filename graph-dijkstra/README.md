# cpp for c programmers
 this code generate an undirected graph with specified number of nodes and a an edge densities as a presetage
 with coast range specified
 compute the average path length from the first node to all other nodes in the generated graph with two different edge dinsity
 20% and 40% 
## the output is as follows:
			- with diensity of :0.2 Average Path Length :6.5
			- with diensity of :0.4 Average Path Length :3.08
